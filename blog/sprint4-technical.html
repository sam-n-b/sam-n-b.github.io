    <h3>A Time I got Blocked</h3>
    <p>During Sprint 3 I got stuck when some JavaScript code was not behaving like I hoped it would. I ended up console logging and receiving an error message I was not familiar with. I tried playing around with the code to understand the problem more but had no success. I then went on to Google and searched the meaning of the error message which helped me fix the problem. If I was unable to fix it from there I would have reached out for help.</p>
    <p>I felt satisfaction in learning to understand the problem and how to fix it. It is a much better feeling than when you fix a problem but you are not quite sure how you did it.</p>
    <h3>Problem Solving Techniques and Process</h3>
    <p><ul>
    <li><b>Pseudocoding</b> - Medium Confidence. Pseudocoding is great for getting out the basic steps needed, helping to give a direction where to start.</li>
    <li><b>Trying Something</b> - High Confidence. This is my general first go to method when I get stuck on something. Failed attempts can help determine what the problem is not.</li>
    <li><b>Rubber Ducky Method</b> - Medium Confidence. - Explaining the problem to “someone else” can be beneficial as you have to understand the problem yourself. Right now I have a bobble-head instead of a ducky.</li>
    <li><b>Console.logging</b> - Medium Confidence. Great at picking up errors and where they are stemming from. I am confident in the feedback of basic errors but can feel lost when it is more complicated.</li>
    <li><b>Googling</b> - High Confidence - Barely a day goes by when I am not asking google for help. The trick is in how to ask the right questions.</li>
<li><b>Asking Others for Help</b> - Low Confidence. I tend to overthink and worry that what I’m asking for help on is silly. This is an area I need to work on.</li>
<li> <b>Improving the Process with Reflection</b> - Medium Confidence. Something I often forget to do but see the value in it.</li>
</p>
</ul>
