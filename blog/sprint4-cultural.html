    <h2>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h2>
<h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
<p>Understanding neuroplasticity can help us to evolve and change our brains by strengthening and changing neural pathways. This can be used to acquire new skills and alter habits. Understanding that our minds are malleable means we can actively take steps to make positive changes and are not forever stuck in certain ways.
        There are many important factors to take in to consideration to help improve neuroplasticity including sleep, stress management, positive outset and a learning environment.
        For myself, knowing that I am not forever stuck with my bad habits is a large confidence builder and if I actively push through my unhelpful routines, I can strengthen other neural pathways and form good habits.
        Reinforcing the importance of a good sleep pattern is also  great for me to recognise as I do not always have the best sleeping habits.
        I found the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0td5aw1KXA">Ted talk from Barbara Arrowsmith-Young</a> particularly fascinating. It shows how powerful mind and neuroplasticity are. 
        
        </p>
<h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
<p>Growth Mindset is a way of thinking that encourages learning and advancement. It is a belief that traits are not fixed and can change.
        Instead of focusing on the fear of failure, there is celebration in trying and challenges are an opportunity for learning.
        In my own learning journey I think it will be important that I embrace challenges instead of getting frustrated and that I use feedback as an opportunity for growth and not see it as a critique on me personally.
        I found the overview of Growth Mindset from <a href="https://www.mindsetworks.com/science/">mindsetworks.com</a> particurlarly interesting.
        </p>
<h3>My Learning Plan</h3>
<p>With my own learning plan and strategy, going forward with a growth mindset and understanding how neuroplasticity can help me will be very beneficial.
        Not getting worked up when I get stuck and embracing the challenges that will come with a positive mindset will help with procrastination habits. Instead of telling myself I can’t do this, I can say I can’t do this yet.
        Learning is a journey and I look forward to the adventures to come.
