<h3>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</h3>
<p>I need to set realistic goals to achieve for each day. Structure helps keep me focused and realistic goals will help prevent me from getting overwhelmed/want to procrastinate. Planning for my week ahead and breaking up the workload in to days and tasks will be important. I am using google sheets and trello to assist me.</p>
<p>As suggested in Sprint 5, I will spend 20 minutes at the start and end of each week of boot camp to reflect on and evaluate my learning plan. At the end of each day I would also like to reflect on the day including what I have learned and any challenges that arose.</p>
<h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h3>
<p>I struggle to ask for help. If I am stuck on a problem for more than one hour I should ask for help. I will try to work it out first. Figuring out problems yourself can be valuable but it is important to be able to ask for help.</p>
<h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h3>
<p>I expect the facilitation team to be able to answer queries in a reasonable amount of time and be reasonably patient.  </p>
