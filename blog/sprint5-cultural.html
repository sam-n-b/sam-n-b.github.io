    <h3>Describe the impact the core learning has had on your Foundations learning journey.</h3>
    <p>Starting out by evaluating my strengths and weaknesses and how that would affect my learning journey has been very beneficial. It has not been something I have actively sat down and written out in my previous studies.</p>
    <p>The section on Mind growth and Neuroplasticity has been fascinating and has given me more confidence and positivity going forward. On a side note - I have typed “neuroplasticity” so many times I can now usually type it without angering the spellchecker. Yay for neural pathways!</p>
    <h3>What are 1 - 3 new things you have learned about yourself as a result of the core learning?</h3>
    Sometimes when I get really stuck on a problem I can lock down in to a fixed mindset. I like the train of thought of “I can’t do this <em>yet</em>” instead of just saying “I can’t do this”.
    Coming in to foundations, I undervalued the importance of self evaluation. The Core part of Foundations has changed my mind considerably.
    
    <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
    Why aren’t these concepts being taught more widely!? The benefits of emotional intelligence and growth mindsets are huge. I had never come across them before.
    <h3>What was the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
    Initially I found the core learning part of foundations a bit tedious and slow. I don’t really enjoy writing about myself. Like I said to my facilitator - Core is a bit like broccoli. I see the value in it but I don’t really walk into the kitchen saying “oh man I want some broccoli.”
    <h3>Any thoughts you want to share about your core learning journey in Foundations?</h3>
I have thoroughly enjoyed the core learning jouney in foundations. Something I never thought I would say.
