            <h3>Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.</h3>
            <p>My personal core values are Compassion, Curiosity, loyalty, kindness and honesty and integrity.</p>
            <b>Compassion</b>
            <p>I tend to take in how others are feeling and I care about the wellbeing of others. I just want everyone to be happy!</p>
            <b>Curiosity</b>
            <p>I have an innate sense of curiosity. I get satisfaction out of learning new things. I also enjoy finding ways to solve problems. Sometimes learning a completely new skill just takes a little confidence and patience. I learnt how to change the cam-belt on a car before I learnt how to fill it up with petrol!</p>
            
            <b>Integrity</b>
            <p>I believe being true to myself and sticking to what I believe is right is important. If I think someone is being treated unfairly I will tend to stick up for them even though I thoroughly dislike confrontation. I believe how you reach an outcome is just as important as the outcome itself.</p>
            
            
            <h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h3>
            <p>One time I was living in a flat where one flatmate wanted to evict another flatmate due to some minor conflicts. He asked for my consent to do so. I believed that this was an unfair decision as not steps for conflict resolution were taken before coming to this outcome and this showed a lack of respect. I declined to even consider eviction until the following steps were taken.
            -The conflicts were identified
            -The issues were communicated to the other party
            -Sufficient reasonable steps were taken to resolve these conflicts.
            This resulted in a slightly awkward living situation for a while but I belive it was the right thing to do.</p>
            
            
            <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>
            <p>I am half NZ european and half Thai. Growing up I moved around a lot and Lived in New Zealand, Iraq, Russia and Thailand. I also spent an extensive amount of time in Saudi Arabia. Having traveled so much I have come across people with many different backgrounds and beliefs. I believe this has helped shaped my view and approach to people. I try to be respectful of the culture and beliefs of others and believe diversity should be celebrated and not avoided. </p>
            
            <h3>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</h3>
           <p><b>Strengths</b> Patient, Considerate, Cooperative, Creative, Curiosity</p>
           <p> <b>Weaknesses</b> Fearful, Undisciplined</p>

            <h3>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h3>
            Patient/Considerate/Cooperative - I tend to get along well with others and am respectful/appreciative of other people’s ideas. It takes a lot for me to get frustrated. In a group environment I have to be careful to make sure my own voice is heard.
            
            Creative - I enjoy creating things and find satisfaction in thinking outside the box to find solutions.
            Curiosity - I like learning new skills and testing them out. If I am stuck on a problem I usually enjoy learning something new to create a solution.
            Undisciplined - I need structure and goals to help maintain being disciplined. Without these I can find it easy to get distracted or procrastinate.
            Fearful - I sometimes doubt my own skills or solutions and don’t want to make an embarrassment of myself. Sometimes I have to consciously stay positive and confident and realise other people may be going through the same fears I am.
            Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.
            
            <h3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h3>
            <p>I was running a childcare program that was also a shared space with the church and an early childhood programme. After complications arose with part of the building needing earthquake strengthening, space was limited so the leaders of the 3 groups met up to work out a solution. Discussions got a little heated with everyone focusing on their own needs. I said we need to stop and refocus. We shouldn’t see it as the child care vs the church vs the early childhood. We should approach it as the 3 groups vs the problem. We were all on the same team. This lead to a much more conducive discussion.
